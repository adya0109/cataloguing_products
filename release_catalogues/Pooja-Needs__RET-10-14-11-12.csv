The company presents many variants of agarbathis so that one can choose according to taste and choice. Indian puja is ever complete without ringing of bells and showing agarbattis (incense sticks) to the deities. Breathing in essential oils and pleasant aromas from burning incense can create various desired effects on us, but these are some of our favorites.Incense has a reputation for being associated with yoga and meditation. Given that some of the essential oils most commonly used to scent incense sticks help ease stress and increase focus, burning incense is a perfect addition to a yoga and meditation routine. Taking in pleasurable aromas actually has the ability to make us happier, trigger fond memories, and boost our moods.
