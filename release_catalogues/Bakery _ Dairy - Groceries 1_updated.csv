Unlike industrial methods where artificial emulsifiers and preservatives are used, our cheese is preserved using 100% natural Himalayan Pink Salt for longer life. ? The milk used to make this cheese is produced by our well-nourished, healthy and stress-free cows. We feed our cows organic fodder which is free from synthetic fertilizers and pesticides. They also roam freely in a paddock area with access to organic pasture and clean drinking water. ? In the traditional artisanal method, the freshly made cheese is pressed into blocks and aged in ripening rooms for 3 months. They are checked every day to ensure the finest quality Mozzarella Cheese is mould-free. ? The ageing process naturally enhances the life of this supreme quality cheese. It also helps in reducing the moisture content in the cheese, leaving behind a solid chunk of cheesy goodness.

Akshayakalpa Smoked Cheddar is handcrafted, organic, and an absolute delight for cheese lovers. No preservatives, artificial additives or flavouring, and emulsifiers are used in this mild cheddar cheese.Made using 100% pure and organic cow milk, our Artisan Organic Cheddar proves to be a nutritious addition to your daily meals. ? Unlike industrial methods where artificial emulsifiers and preservatives are used, our cheese is preserved using 100% natural Himalayan Pink Salt for longer life. ? The milk used to make this delectable cheese is produced by our well-nourished, stress-free and healthy cows. Our cattle are fed pesticide-free fodder and allowed to roam freely in open paddock areas which have an abundance of organic pasture and clean drinking water. ? Made using the artisanal method, we add microbial rennet to produce fresh cheddar instead of animal rennet. The cheese blocks are aged for 3 months in ripening rooms where extensive checks are conducted every day to keep them mould-free.Cheese crackers or cheese balls, this smoked cheddar adds creamy, earthy goodness to all your dishes.

As a result, the 33% protein content in Kodai Parmesan compares to a 20% protein content in lean beef, but takes just 45 minutes to digest. And while you may think that Parmesan has a high fat content, much of the fat is in the form of short fatty acids that are absorbed quickly and supply energy very quickly into the body.
