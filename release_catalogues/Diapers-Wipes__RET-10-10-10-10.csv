First of all, prepare a suitable place to change diapers. For hygienic diaper changing always use Happy Underpad on the changing table. It's very important to have all accessories at hand: clean Happy Diaper, Happy Wet Wipes, a bowl with water, Bella Cotton Pads to clean your baby's bottom and baby powder (optional).
Undo your baby's clothes and Happy Diaper. Don't be surprised if the baby starts to pee right away - babies often do that when they are undressed and feel a chill. If your baby has pooped, gently wipe its bottom with the clean half of the diaper, fold it and tuck it under your baby's buttocks.
Never leave your baby on a changing table unattended even for a second. The baby could fall off! Clean the diaper area with Happy Wet Wipes. Wiping from front to back helps to prevent spreading bacteria. Also, make sure that you thoroughly clean between the skin folds. Then clean your baby's bottom thoroughly with Bella Cotton Pads soaked in warm water or Happy Wet Wipes. Then, apply a protective cream/baby powder.
Now lift your baby's buttocks with your hands (do not lift by pulling the legs!) and put a new Happy Diaper under the baby's bottom. Fasten the velcro side tapes. Always fasten the diaper symmetrically and not too tightly. Refer to the symmetrical illustrations on both sides of the Happy Diaper. Now dress your baby. See - it was not that bad! As a reward, you can see your baby's smiling face and healthy bottom!","['EAN Code: 40103266', 'Country of origin: Poland', '",-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-
