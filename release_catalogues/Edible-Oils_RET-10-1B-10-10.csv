The terms used in olive oil tasting are similar to those used in wine tasting. Good oil should be balanced, with the body and round flavours that develop in the mouth. General terms such as fruity, mature, pungent, bitter or sweet are used alongside other more specific associations such as grass, green leaves, almond or apple.
Pour approximately 1 tablespoon of Olive Oil in a small glass. Cover the glass with one hand and shake it delicately until the oil sticks on to the entire inside surface. Warm the oil in the glass with your hands till it is close to body temperature.
Lift the glass to your nose and sniff thrice, deeply (raising your nose up and away from the oil between each sniff).
Olive oils have aromas just like wine. Take a sip (approx. 10 drops into the mouth). Roll the olive oil around in your mouth for approximately 5 seconds.
The oil should touch all areas of the mouth so that the various tastes and sensations can be noted. Between tasting each kind of olive oil, drink lots of water and eat a small piece of bread to cleanse your palate.","['EAN Code: 8906018511137', 'Manufactured by: Nicola pantaleo, S.P.A 72015 Fasno Di pugali italy', 'Country of origin: Italy', 'Best before 25-02-2024', 'For Queries/Feedback/Complaints, Contact our Customer Care Executive at: Phone: 1860 123 1000 | Address: Innovative Retail Concepts Private Limited, Ranka Junction 4th Floor, Tin Factory bus stop.
