Idli and dosa are the most popular healthy south Indian foods. They are made from rice and black lentils. Idlis are made in a specialized mould and eaten with different items like chutney, vegetable stew or other flavorful toppings for breakfast or as a snack. Typically, an idli/dosa batter involves a three-step recipe which includes soaking the rice, grinding and fermenting it. But with this readymade batter, you can make crispy dosa and fluffy soft idlis at no time at all. This Batter serves to cook 17 to 20 idlis of 12 to 14 dosa. Idlis contain no cholesterol, no fat, and no saturated fat. These small healthy south Indian food treats are good for you and, as a bonus, convenient for those on the go. To make your diet a bit healthier, swap a doughnut or muffin for healthy south Indian food idli/dosa.

A great substitute for homemade Rotis, these paranthas are made of 100% whole wheat and can be eaten any time with your favourite vegetable curry.
