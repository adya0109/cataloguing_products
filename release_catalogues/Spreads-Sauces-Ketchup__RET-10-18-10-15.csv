Some are pure, while others may be highly adulterated. As a consumer, one needs to be watchful as adulterated honey comes with added glucose, sugar syrup, molasses, corn syrup, etc. Not every honey that reads pure necessarily stands true to its claim.

ZOE ACV is 100 per cent pure and has the goodness of mother of vinegar that lends it a cloudy look, but is an affirmation of high quality unprocessed vinegar. Loaded with potent antioxidants and minerals ZOE ACV is an elixir of life. Honey is well known for its medicinal properties, particularly anti-inflammatory and alleviate allergies. Honey absorbs calcium, the natural form of unprocessed sugars such as fructose. The glucose present in honey quickly boosts energy levels. Finally, it helps to regulate sleep cycles and soothe the scalp. Lemon is helpful in treating cold and flu. In addition to that, it flushes out toxins by stimulating the liver. Gallstones, calcium deposits and kidney stones stand no chance against citric acid, which is strong enough to combat intestinal worms and deadly pathogens but gentle enough to avoid affecting the immune system. Lemon also stimulates the intestines, thus helping with regularity in bowel movements. Tangerine, a potent phytonutrient, is effective in treating neural disorders like Parkinsons. Ginger contains Gingerol, an anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant rich substance that protects you against cancer and age-related brain damage. With a daily dose of this handy supplement, you can say goodbye to nausea and menstrual pain. Muscle soreness too can be bettered using ginger, as can osteoarthritis. It's helpful for diabetes patients, as ginger lowers blood sugar levels and prevents heart diseases. Ginger is also helpful in cleansing the stomach and reducing cholesterol levels. Garlic protects against chronic diseases, cell damage and age with anti-oxidants and allicin, highly beneficial compounds in garlic. Rich in Vitamin B6, Vitamin C and Manganese, garlic boosts your immunity and prevents the onset of the common cold. Its also a go-to cure for hypertension and toxicity, and significantly lowers cholesterol levels, thus improving physical performance. Finally, by acting as a catalyst for oestrogen production, garlic improves bone health. Fenugreek (Methi) helps in removing body toxins, digestive disorders, constipation and cures acidity. Helps in inducing insulin level, reduces blood control sugar and triglycerides level. Methi seed reduces the bad cholesterol level (low density lipoprotein, LDL) in the blood thus reduces the risk cardiovascular diseases. It is very helpful in treating the kidney ailments and deficiency symptoms of the vitamin like mouth ulcers, baldness, chronic coughs, chapped lips, beriberi, boils, cellulitis, tuberculosis, bronchitis, cancer and etc. Fenugreek seeds are the excellent source of electrolyte potassium which help in controlling the heart rate as well as blood pressure by counteracting the sodium action.

Loaded with potent antioxidants and minerals ZOE ACV is an elixir of life. Honey is well known for its medicinal properties, particularly anti-inflammatory and alleviate allergies. Honey absorbs calcium, the natural form of unprocessed sugars such as fructose. The glucose present in honey quickly boosts energy levels. Finally, it helps to regulate sleep cycles and soothe the scalp. Lemon is helpful in treating cold and flu. In addition to that, it flushes out toxins by stimulating the liver. Gallstones, calcium deposits and kidney stones stand no chance against citric acid, which is strong enough to combat intestinal worms and deadly pathogens but gentle enough to avoid affecting the immune system. Lemon also stimulates the intestines, thus helping with regularity in bowel movements. Tangerine, a potent phytonutrient, is effective in treating neural disorders like Parkinsons. Ginger contains Gingerol, an anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant rich substance that protects you against cancer and age-related brain damage. With a daily dose of this handy supplement, you can say goodbye to nausea and menstrual pain. Muscle soreness too can be bettered using ginger, as can osteoarthritis. It's helpful for diabetes patients, as ginger lowers blood sugar levels and prevents heart diseases. Ginger is also helpful in cleansing the stomach and reducing cholesterol levels. Garlic protects you against chronic diseases, cell damage and age with anti-oxidants and allicin, highly beneficial compounds in garlic. Rich in Vitamin B6, Vitamin C and Manganese, garlic boosts your immunity and prevents the onset of the common cold. It's also a go-to cure for hypertension and toxicity, and significantly lowers cholesterol levels, thus improving physical performance. Finally, by acting as a catalyst for oestrogen production, garlic improves bone health.
