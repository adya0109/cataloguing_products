It works by creating strong foam every time you flush the toilet, which helps to maintain cleanliness in the toilet bowl. Harpic Flushmatic toilet cleaner works from inside the cistern to release a dose of powerful detergent with every flush. Distributing the liquid across the bowl, it helps you maintain a hygienic and fresh toilet and prevents the build-up of stains giving you a continuous clean toilet. You need not remove the pleated cloth wrapper on the block as this will dissolve in the water till it finishes, just drop the block directly into the cistern. For best results drop it at the opposite end to the water inlet, by the float. Wait for 10 minutes to let the block mix, before the first flush. Harpic Flushmatic toilet cistern block is a toilet hygiene product for continuous cleaning without any mess. It is touch free and hygienic and dissolves completely when finished. A single block lasts up to a month depending upon individual usage. Also, it lets you know when it needs replacing as the colour of the flushed water starts to fade. To keep the freshness going replace it with a new Flushmatic block as soon as the colour starts to fade. Harpic Flushmatic toilet cleaner is safe to be used with septic tanks and all other toilet cleaners. For regular cleaning, use Harpic liquid.

It works by creating strong foam every time you flush the toilet, which helps to maintain cleanliness in the toilet bowl. Harpic Flushmatic toilet cleaner works from inside the cistern to release a dose of powerful detergent with every flush. Distributing the liquid across the bowl, it helps you maintain a hygienic and fresh toilet and prevents the build-up of stains giving you a continuous clean toilet. You need not remove the pleated cloth wrapper on the block as this will dissolve in the water till it finishes, just drop the block directly into the cistern. For best results drop it at the opposite end to the water inlet, by the float. Wait for 10 minutes to let the block mix, before the first flush. Harpic Flushmatic toilet cistern block is a toilet hygiene product for continuous cleaning without any mess. It is touch free and hygienic and dissolves completely when finished. A single block lasts up to a month depending upon individual usage. Also, it lets you know when it needs replacing as the colour of the flushed water starts to fade.

It works by creating strong foam every time you flush the toilet, which helps to maintain cleanliness in the toilet bowl. Harpic Flushmatic toilet cleaner works from inside the cistern to release a dose of powerful detergent with every flush. Distributing the liquid across the bowl, it helps you maintain a hygienic and fresh toilet and prevents the build-up of stains giving you a continuous clean toilet. You need not remove the pleated cloth wrapper on the block as this will dissolve in the water till it finishes, just drop the block directly into the cistern. For best results drop it at the opposite end to the water inlet, by the float. Wait for 10 minutes to let the block mix, before the first flush. Harpic Flushmatic toilet cistern block is a toilet hygiene product for continuous cleaning without any mess. It is touch free and hygienic and dissolves completely when finished. A single block lasts up to a month depending upon individual usage. Also, it lets you know when it needs replacing as the colour of the flushed water starts to fade. To keep the freshness going replace it with a new Flushmatic block as soon as the colour starts to fade. Harpic Flushmatic toilet cleaner is safe to be used with septic tanks and all other toilet cleaners. For regular cleaning, use Harpic liquid.

It works by creating strong foam every time you flush the toilet, which helps to maintain cleanliness in the toilet bowl. Harpic Flushmatic toilet cleaner works from inside the cistern to release a dose of powerful detergent with every flush. Distributing the liquid across the bowl, it helps you maintain a hygienic and fresh toilet and prevents the build-up of stains giving you a continuous clean toilet. You need not remove the pleated cloth wrapper on the block as this will dissolve in the water till it finishes, just drop the block directly into the cistern. For best results drop it at the opposite end to the water inlet, by the float. Wait for 10 minutes to let the block mix, before the first flush. Harpic Flushmatic toilet cistern block is a toilet hygiene product for continuous cleaning without any mess. It is touch free and hygienic and dissolves completely when finished. A single block lasts up to a month depending upon individual usage. Also, it lets you know when it needs replacing as the colour of the flushed water starts to fade. To keep the freshness going replace it with a new Flushmatic block as soon as the colour starts to fade. Harpic Flushmatic toilet cleaner is safe to be used with septic tanks and all other toilet cleaners. For regular cleaning, use Harpic liquid.

With every single order, you are saying no to Chemicals that seep out of our homes with wastewater and pollute the earth and water bodies. The CARE formula has been developed in the lab by environmental scientists and tested in homes by parents for performance, including our own team. We created this amazing solution to deliver a zero stress, tension-free experience while cleaning all home surfaces. The Floor Cleaner is a natural Degreaser, Cleaner and Odor Controller that you can use for deep cleaning, sanitizing and odour control features. It is very useful for hard surfaces like Shiny Floor Surfaces, Polished Granite and Marble, Glass & Mirrors, Bathroom and Household fixtures, Kitchen & Bathroom Sinks, Drains and Garbage areas. The solution is non-toxic and biodegradable which means that it is safe to use it in any area of your home. The Floor Cleaner uses active enzymes which are the most effective ingredients to remove and eliminate stains and odours. These plant-based proteins quickly break down substances like grease, food spills, fats, oils, dry skin, dirt, and urine. That means that instead of just wiping away the stains or fungal growth, the Floor Cleaner breaks down those stains into oxygen, hydrogen, and carbon and prevents the disease-causing organisms to grow back again.",,"EKAM ECO SOLUTIONS PVT LTD,C/O RUTU BIOSYSTEM, S.
