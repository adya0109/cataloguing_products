Our Artisan Organic Pizza Cheese is made using 100% pure and organic cows milk. Unlike industrial methods where artificial emulsifiers and preservatives are used, our cheese is preserved using 100% natural Himalayan Pink Salt for longer life. ? The milk used to make this cheese is produced by our well-nourished, healthy and stress-free cows. We feed our cows organic fodder which is free from synthetic fertilizers and pesticides. They also roam freely in a paddock area with access to organic pasture and clean drinking water. ? In the traditional artisanal method, the freshly made cheese is pressed into blocks and aged in ripening rooms for 3 months. They are checked every day to ensure the finest quality Mozzarella Cheese is mould-free. ? The ageing process naturally enhances the life of this supreme quality cheese. It also helps in reducing the moisture content in the cheese, leaving behind a solid chunk of cheesy goodness.

Anything she explained to us about the taste it adds to our favourite food fell on deaf ears. Until, one day, she decided to teach us a lesson by not adding jeera to the buttermilk that she used to so lovingly used to make at home. She went a step further just to make her point and made us buttermilk with no additives, not even the usual salt and pepper. One gulp and we knew what had happened.
