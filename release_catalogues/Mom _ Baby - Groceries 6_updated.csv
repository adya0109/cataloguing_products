Generally, a newborn's skin is very delicate and fragile, and using just any product can cause irreparable damage to their skin. To make sure that your babys skin maintains its soft and supple nature, Healofy Naturals baby lotion is made from all the natural ingredients like avocado which helps in hydrating and moisturising dry and flaky skin. The baby lotion also contains Aloe Vera which helps to soothe the redness and itchiness of the newborn.
The Shea butter in the lotion helps in giving softness and smoothens the skin with its generous amounts of Vitamin A and E. We also added the neem as it helps babies fight germs and ensure they are safe from skin infections. Finally, the hibiscus helps in maintaining smooth skin by improving the skin texture with extra nourishment. All these organic ingredients also ensure that your baby is comfortable and protected from rashes, itchiness and hyper-sensitive skin. Your babys skin is expected to be touchy and soft all the time, but since there are environmental differences from the mothers womb to the outside world, the texture of your babys skin needs extra attention from time to time to protect your baby from any kind of discomfort.", , ,"Bo International,A -91,Wazirpur Industrial Area,New Delhi - 110052",India,-,-,-,-,-,https://datalabs.siva3.io/images/Eunimart_groceries_40277478_1-healofy-naturals-moisturising-baby-lotion-with-shea-butter-toxin-free-for-soft-supple-skin.jpg, https://datalabs.siva3.io/images/Eunimart_groceries_40277478-2_1-healofy-naturals-moisturising-baby-lotion-with-shea-butter-toxin-free-for-soft-supple-skin.jpg, https://datalabs.siva3.io/images/Eunimart_groceries_40277478-3_1-healofy-naturals-moisturising-baby-lotion-with-shea-butter-toxin-free-for-soft-supple-skin.jpg, https://datalabs.siva3.io/images/Eunimart_groceries_40277478-4_1-healofy-naturals-moisturising-baby-lotion-with-shea-butter-toxin-free-for-soft-supple-skin.jpg, https://datalabs.siva3.io/images/Eunimart_groceries_40277478-5_1-healofy-naturals-moisturising-baby-lotion-with-shea-butter-toxin-free-for-soft-supple-skin.jpg, https://datalabs.siva3.io/images/Eunimart_groceries_40277478-6_1-healofy-naturals-moisturising-baby-lotion-with-shea-butter-toxin-free-for-soft-supple-skin.jpg, https://datalabs.siva3.io/images/Eunimart_groceries_40277478-7_1-healofy-naturals-moisturising-baby-lotion-with-shea-butter-toxin-free-for-soft-supple-skin.jpg, https://datalabs.siva3.io/images/Eunimart_groceries_40277478-8_1-healofy-naturals-moisturising-baby-lotion-with-shea-butter-toxin-free-for-soft-supple-skin.jpg, https://datalabs.siva3.io/images/Eunimart_groceries_40277478-9_1-healofy-naturals-moisturising-baby-lotion-with-shea-butter-toxin-free-for-soft-supple-skin.jpg,, ,Healofy Naturals ,1,1,'8906147490013,, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,,Apply a generous amount of lotion to the baby's face and body.,"VIVOIZ Healthtech Pvt.

Boil clean drinking water for 5 minutes. Allow cooling. Measure 75ml and pour lukewarm water into babyâs bowl.
Add 3 levelled scoops of Cerelac.
Stir until the cereal is smooth and feed immediately using a clean spoon.

Optimal Preparation: Careful and hygienic preparation of Infant food is most essential for health. Do not use fewer scoops than directed, since diluted feeding will not provide adequate nutrients needed by your infant. Do not use more scoops than directed since concentrated feed will not provide the water needed by your infant.
Storage: After opening the pack, the contents should immediately be transferred to an empty, clean, dry and airtight container. Replace the lid tightly after every use and store it in a cool, dry place. Ensure the enclosed scoop is thoroughly washed and dried before use. After opening, use the contents within 3 weeks or the expiry date, whichever is earlier.
 Important Notice: Motherâs milk is best for your baby.
 Safety Warnings: Infant food should be used only on the advice of a health worker as to the need for its use and the proper method of its use. Infant food is not the sole source of nourishment for an infant. Use prepared feed within half an hour otherwise microbial deterioration may set in. Discard unused feed.",,

First of all, prepare a suitable place to change diapers. For hygienic diaper changing always use Happy Underpad on the changing table. It's very important to have all accessories at hand: clean Happy Diaper, Happy Wet Wipes, a bowl with water, Bella Cotton Pads to clean your babys bottom and baby powder (optional).
Undo your babys clothes and Happy Diaper. Do not be surprised if the baby starts to pee right away - babies often do that when they are undressed and feel a chill. If your baby has pooped, gently wipe its bottom with the clean half of the diaper, fold it and tuck it under your babys buttocks. Never leave your baby on a changing table unattended even for a second. The baby could fall off!
Clean the diaper area with Happy Wet Wipes. Wiping from front to back helps to prevent spreading bacteria. Also, make sure that you thoroughly clean between the skin folds. Then clean your babys bottom thoroughly with Bella Cotton Pads soaked in warm water or Happy Wet Wipes. Then, apply a protective cream/baby powder. Now lift your babys buttocks with your hands (do not lift by pulling the legs!) and put a new Happy Diaper under the babys bottom.
Fasten the velcro side tapes. Always fasten the diaper symmetrically and not too tightly. Refer to the symmetrical illustrations on both sides of the Happy Diaper. Now dress your baby. See - it was not that bad! As a reward, you can see your babys smiling face and healthy bottom!",,

Undo your baby's clothes and Happy Diaper. Don't be surprised if the baby starts to pee right away - babies often do that when they are undressed and feel a chill. If your baby has pooped, gently wipe its bottom with the clean half of the diaper, fold it and tuck it under your baby's buttocks.
Never leave your baby on a changing table unattended even for a second. The baby could fall off! Clean the diaper area with Happy Wet Wipes. Wiping from front to back helps to prevent spreading bacteria. Also, make sure that you thoroughly clean between the skin folds. Then clean your baby's bottom thoroughly with Bella Cotton Pads soaked in warm water or Happy Wet Wipes. Then, apply a protective cream/baby powder.
Now lift your baby's buttocks with your hands (do not lift by pulling the legs!) and put a new Happy Diaper under the baby's bottom. Fasten the velcro side tapes. Always fasten the diaper symmetrically and not too tightly. Refer to the symmetrical illustrations on both sides of the Happy Diaper. Now dress your baby. See - it was not that bad!

Also, check the wetness indicator- when it's time to change the diaper, the indicator will become blurred and grey.
First of all, prepare a suitable place to change diapers. For hygienic diaper changing always use Happy Underpad on the changing table. It's very important to have all accessories at hand: clean Happy Diaper, Happy Sensitive Wet Wipes, a bowl with water, Bella Cotton Pads to clean your baby's bottom and a baby powder (optional). Undo your baby's clothes and Happy Diaper.
Do not be surprised if the baby starts to pee right away - babies often do that when they are undressed and feel a chill. If your baby has pooped, gently wipe its bottom with the clean half of the diaper, fold it and tuck it under your baby's buttocks. Never leave your baby on a changing table unattended even for a second. The baby could fall off! Clean the diaper area with Happy Wet Wipes. Wiping from front to back helps to prevent from spreading bacteria. Also, make sure that you thoroughly clean between the skin folds.
Then clean your baby's bottom thoroughly with a Bella Cotton Pads soaked in warm water or Happy Wet Wipes. . Next, apply a protective cream/baby powder.
Now lift your baby's buttocks with your hands (do not lift by pulling the legs!) and put a new Happy Diaper under the baby's bottom. Fasten the velcro side tapes. Always fasten the diaper symmetrically and not too tightly. Refer to the symmetrical illustrations on both sides of the Happy Diaper.
