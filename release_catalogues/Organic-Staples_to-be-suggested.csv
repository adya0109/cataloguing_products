These cows are grass-fed and are not factory-farmed and are free from cross-breeding, which gives our Ghee its special, natural qualities.
AN ANCIENT SECRET PASSED DOWN THROUGH GENERATIONS: We employ a traditional 3000-year-old Vedic method originating in a Rajasthani village called Bilona (hand-churn) to craft our A2 ghee. The process involves boiling raw, unprocessed cow milk and then, converting it to curd in a clay pot. Furthermore, the curd is hand-churned (from the boiled milk) to help retain the nutrients. The final step is separating the butter to form the ghee.
REVEL IN THE RICHNESS OF A2 GHEE: The A2 milk which is used to make our ghee contains beta-casein protein that's supremely rich in nutrients such as calcium, iron, sodium and fat-soluble vitamins A, D and E, as well as Omega-3 and Omega-6 fatty acids. Ghee obtained from curd instead of the cream of cows contains good fats, and can be easily digested by the body - this is because it aids the gastric juices in your system to break down foods you consume.
HEALS AND NOURISHES THE BODY: Regular consumption of our high-quality A2 ghee helps reduce cholesterol, improves the heart's functioning and reduces joint pain. It is also known for its external healing properties. You can apply it to soothe skin burns or sunburns. In winter months, you can use it as a moisturiser to get rid of dry and flaky skin.
HEALTHY BODIES, BEATING HEARTS: Our ghee is Keto and Paleo diet friendly. It is suitable for adults as well as children. Use our natural A2 ghee to add a flavour to your favourite meals. Since it has a high heating point it retains all the essential nutrients while cooking. The ways to experiment with our A2 ghee are exciting and unlimited.",500 ml,ml,500 ml,1,1,1499,1119,"Alpha Milk Foods Pvt.
