Shade-grown, nutrient-rich young Tencha green tea leaves are steamed, deveined, destemmed, dried and stone-ground into fine Matcha powder which is then consumed with water, ultimately leading to ingestion of whole tea leaves, making Matcha an extremely potent form of green tea or the elixir of the immortals as popularly known.

Freedom of Choice:  With Taj Mahal Teabags, you enjoy the freedom to conveniently choose the tea that you want. Choose from a range of Indian flavours - Spicy Ginger, Fragrant Cardamom, Rich Masala and Fresh Lemon. You may like to try Taj Mahal Honey & Lemon Green Tea bags as well.
Constructed with care: At Brooke Bond Taj Mahal, we pay attention to every detail, in our commitment to excellence so that you can savour the best. Even in how our tea bags are constructed. We make them from a special kind of paper that does not disintegrate in water. Each bag is made as two chambers, which ensures that more water can contact the tea within them and thus brew faster. Introducing tea bags also meant that a new blend had to be created that was suited for instant brewing",249 g (25 Bags x 9.9 g each),g,249 g (25 Bags x 9.9 g each),1,1,155,155,"Hindustan Unilever Limited, Unilever House, B D Sawant Marg, Chakala, Anderi E, Mumbai - 400099",India,['8901030520174'],-,https://datalabs.siva3.io/image/Eunimart_groceries_440572_6-taj-mahal-tea-spicy-ginger.jpg,https://datalabs.siva3.io/image/Eunimart_groceries_440572-2_1-taj-mahal-tea-spicy-ginger.jpg,https://datalabs.siva3.io/image/Eunimart_groceries_440572-3_2-taj-mahal-tea-spicy-ginger.jpg,https://datalabs.siva3.io/image/Eunimart_groceries_440572-4_2-taj-mahal-tea-spicy-ginger.jpg,https://datalabs.siva3.io/image/Eunimart_groceries_440572-5_2-taj-mahal-tea-spicy-ginger.jpg,https://datalabs.siva3.io/image/Eunimart_groceries_440572-6_1-taj-mahal-tea-spicy-ginger.jpg,https://datalabs.siva3.io/image/Eunimart_groceries_440572-7_2-taj-mahal-tea-spicy-ginger.jpg,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,"Taj Mahal Teas are Tasted, graded and perfectly blended at the Brooke bond Tea Excellence Centre
