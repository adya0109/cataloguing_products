After the outer husk (or chaff) has been removed from the still bran-covered oat grains, the remainder is called oat groats. Oat groats are a whole grain that can be used as a breakfast cereal; various forms of oatmeal and rolled oats, and pinhead oats are cooked to make porridge. Our Gluten Free Old Fashioned Rolled Oats make a deliciously hearty, wholesome hot cereal that gives you lasting energy.

But did you know? Why just a bite or maybe a small bar of dark chocolate brightens up your mood, every time you eat it.

For ages, Dark Chocolate has been considered a stress reliever. It becomes quite difficult to maintain a stress-free lifestyle with the current lifestyle while giving up on your dark chocolate cravings. Hence, how about fulfilling the dark chocolate temptation with a healthier crunch to keep you on your healthy lifestyle track? How Chocolate Granola can be beneficial? True Elements Chocolate Granola is not just a non-sugar healthier variant of Granola but is also enhanced with the exquisite aroma of Natural Chocolate Flavour, rich enough to take you on an indulgent journey of Chocolate.
