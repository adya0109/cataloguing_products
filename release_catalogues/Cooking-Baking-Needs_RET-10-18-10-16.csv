Ingredients: 1 pack rice paper ( any size, the ones used above are 8.5 inches in diameter) 1 cup sliced purple cabbage or more 1 cup sliced carrots 1 cup Peanut Rice paper Dipping Sauce 1/2 cup sliced scallions 1/2-2/3 cup cilantro leaves 2 avocados pitted and sliced 1 cup chopped kale leaves 1/2 cup mint leaves.
Instructions:
1. Prepare your fillings. In a large shallow plate, add some hot water (boiling is ok) to fill up halfway up the plate. 
2. Place the rice paper rolls one at a time in the hot water plate and let it soak for a few seconds until it softens and becomes malleable”but not fragile and slimy. 
3. Place the sheet of rice paper roll on your counter, flattening it to its original circular shape. 
4. Along the centre of the rice paper roll (length-wise) start arranging your fillings”add more or less, swap any ingredient you prefer.
5. Start rolling your rice paper from the edge near you and then tuck the corners and continue until it forms a firm roll. 
6. Repeat with the rest. Chill the rice paper rolls until ready to serve. When serving, slice each roll in half and serve on their own or with Peanut Rice Paper dipping sauce.
Recipe Notes: When buying the rice paper, make sure it's not broken already. The rice paper sheets are sold in about 3 different sizes, its totally optional which size you chose but the most commonly used size is the 8 1/2 inch diameter - almost the size of a flour tortilla. The most commonly used rice paper is the ""all rice"" version, but youll find some with starch, tapioca and a combo of rice flours. When soaking your rice paper, make sure to not over soak them to a point where they become fragile and tear up easily. Soak your rice paper sheets just until they start to soften and become malleable, but not fragile. Dont overstuff! Its super tempting to keep on piling up goodies on top of your rice paper but in the end, you wont be able to roll them without tearing them apart.","['EAN Code: __EAN __', 'FSSAI NO: 10012011000629', 'Country of Origin: Thailand', 'Manufacturer Name & : THAITAN FOODS INTERNATIONAL CO. , LTD., 2529/163, Trok Nokket, Rama 3 Rd. , Bangklo, Bang kho laem, Bangkok 10120 Thailand', 'Imported & Marketed By: Rama Vision Ltd.

Ingredients: 1 pack rice paper ( any size, the ones used above are 8.5 inches in diameter) 1 cup sliced purple cabbage or more 1 cup sliced carrots 1 cup Rice paper Dipping Sauce 1/2 cup sliced scallions 1/2-2/3 cup cilantro leaves 2 avocados pitted and sliced 1 cup chopped kale leaves 1/2 cup mint leaves 
Instructions For Cooking:
1. Prepare your fillings. In a large shallow plate, add some hot water (boiling is ok) to fill up halfway up the plate. 
2. Place the rice paper rolls one at a time in the hot water plate and let it soak for a few seconds until it softens and becomes malleable”but not fragile and slimy. 
3. Place the sheet of rice paper roll on your counter, flattening it to its original circular shape. 
4. Along the centre of the rice paper roll (length-wise) start arranging your fillings”add more or less, swap any ingredient you prefer. 
5. Start rolling your rice paper from the edge near you and then tuck the corners and continue until it forms a firm roll. 
6. Repeat with the rest. Chill the rice paper rolls until ready to serve. When serving, slice each roll in half and serve on their own or with Rice Paper dipping sauce. 
Recipe Notes: When buying the rice paper, make sure it's not broken already. The rice paper sheets are sold in about 3 different sizes, its totally optional which size you chose but the most commonly used size is the 8 1/2 inch diameter”almost the size of a flour tortilla. The most commonly used rice paper is the ""all rice"" version, but youll find some with starch, tapioca and a combo of rice flours. When soaking your rice paper, make sure to not over soak them to a point where they become fragile and tear up easily. Soak your rice paper sheets just until they start to soften and become malleable, but not fragile. Dont overstuff! Its super tempting to keep on piling up goodies on top of your rice paper but in the end, you wont be able to roll them without tearing them apart.","['EAN Code: __EAN __', 'FSSAI NO: 10012011000629', 'Country of Origin: Thailand', 'Manufacturer Name & : THAITAN FOODS INTERNATIONAL CO. , LTD., 2529/163, Trok Nokket, Rama 3 Rd. , Bangklo, Bang kho laem, Bangkok 10120 Thailand', 'Imported & Marketed By: Rama Vision Ltd.

Sprig Wasabi paste has an unbelievable potency and adds a delightful bite to every dish. A tiny dab of this paste can even add an interesting dimension to vegetables like carrots and sweet potatoes. You can use it as a side with sushi, or roll it into sushi as one of the main ingredients.
Want to make great sushi? Or make your tempura sing in your mouth? The key ingredient that delivers a punch to both your sushi and your tempura is the wasabi paste. Sprig wasabi paste is now available in a convenient easy to use tube form. What is wasabi? Wasabi has its origins in Japanese cuisine. Wasabi root is actually the stem of the plant that is ground into a fine paste and consumed with sushi and other Japanese dishes. It is not spicy like a chilli paste, but it packs a wallop. It has a strong pungent taste that hits the roof of your nose rather than your tongue. It has a bite that is similar to the Bengali kasundi but much more stronger and with a clean herbal taste. Wasabi should be ingested in small quantities. It produces strong fumes that rise up and hits your nose and can potentially clear a nasal congestion! Wasabi is also available in powder form that you need to mix with water to get the desired consistency. Sprig wasabi paste comes premixed in a tube that is ready to use. How to use wasabi paste? Sprig wasabi paste can be used as a condiment with sushi and sashimi. You can mix it with mayonnaise and add it to sandwich or use it as a creamy dip. You can also use it as a dipping sauce for tempura/ fritters/ bajia/ pakoras. A huge variety of hors doeuvres can be spiced up with wasabi paste. You can add it to deviled eggs, salmon with wasabi soy and honey sauce and who can forget the wasabi peas that are very a popular snack. Wasabi can also be used alongside fish like tuna. Benefits? Seared tuna with wasabi butter sauce is the perfect dish for a Friday night indulgence. Wasabi, with its antibacterial properties, is very good for your health. Wasabi paste actually kills any bacteria that are present in the raw fish in sushi. Its vapour is so strong that it is used to treat respiratory problems like cough, cold or sinus. Wasabi can also stimulate the appetite and remove toxins from the body.

It is a pseudocereal, similar in some respects to buckwheat, rather than a true cereal, as it is not a member of the true grass family. As a chenopod, quinoa is closely related to species such as beetroots, spinach and tumbleweeds. As a member of the Amaranthaceae family, it is related to and resembles amaranth, which is also a pseudocereal. After harvest, the seeds must be processed to remove the coating containing the bitter tasting saponins. It is 100% natural and vegan. It has a mild and slightly nutty flavor. It has a fluffy texture that is somewhat chewy. It also tastes similar to brown rice but has a nuttier earthy flavor.
