If it fizzles out midway (and your energy crashes by noon), itÇs because the energy release was fast and spiky. Not slow and steady. We crafted these Mueslis to tick all those boxes and more.
Here are how: Balanced Macros: Unlike traditional breakfast cereals that are loaded with carbs (and little else), only half the energy here comes from carbs. And the other half from good fats & proteins. Sustained Energy: The majority of the carbs are complex, slow-release carbs from whole grains. Which means steady energy release that gets you through the day. Low Insulin Impact: The complex carbs and natural fibres help avoid a sudden insulin surge. No spikes and crashes. No refined sugar: No refined sugar: Sugar ainÇt bad. Refined, nutritionally empty sugar is.
PS: We have a 'No added sugar' muesli now if you'd like.
Portion controlled: The real problem with sugary breakfast cereal is how much we eat of it. Both as breakfast and generally - as a snack.
