Whether you eat chia gel or just the raw seeds, the hydrophilic action of chia seed will keep you full longer than many other seeds. Amazingly, chia gel can also be used as a substitute for eggs in many baked goods. Increase The Value Of Any Meal- The mild, nutty flavour of chia seed goes well with both sweet and savoury dishes. Use Nourish You chia seeds in puddings and smoothies, sprinkle on top of porridge and salads, and add to baked goods in place of flaxseed meal or poppy seeds. The gelling nature of chia makes it an ideal (and nutritious) substitute for pectin in jam. No matter the dish, you can increase the nutritional value of any meal with a sprinkle of Nourish You chia seeds.","Nutrition supplement - direct intake, In water, juices, Salads, etc","['EAN Code: 40038150', 'Country of origin: India', '",-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-
