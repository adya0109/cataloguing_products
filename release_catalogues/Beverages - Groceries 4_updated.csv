A pinch of lemon adds Vitamin C to boost your immunity. Hibiscus - Hibiscus has a long history of being a medicinal plant and has been used in a number of traditional medicinal remedies. It contains an abundance of antioxidants and this is believed to help protect the body against free radicals. What are free radicals? Well, this might get a little technical but stay with me. Oxygen in the body splits into single atoms with unpaid electrons. The electrons like to be paired so these atoms are called free radicals. These atoms then damage the cells in the body by causing a change in the cell membranes and DNA. This abnormality results in diseases like cancer, diabetes, asthma, senile dementia etc. To reduce free radicals one needs to have antioxidant-rich food that neutralizes the free radicals", , ,"fermwell Foods Pvt Ltd ,106 Andheri universal estate, JP Road, Andheri West, Mumbai 58",India,-,-,-,-,-,https://datalabs.siva3.io/images/Eunimart_groceries_40210396_2-bombucha-hibiscus-lime-kombucha.jpg,https://datalabs.siva3.io/images/Eunimart_groceries_40210396-2_2-bombucha-hibiscus-lime-kombucha.jpg,https://datalabs.siva3.io/images/Eunimart_groceries_40210396-3_2-bombucha-hibiscus-lime-kombucha.jpg,https://datalabs.siva3.io/images/Eunimart_groceries_40210396-4_2-bombucha-hibiscus-lime-kombucha.jpg,https://datalabs.siva3.io/images/Eunimart_groceries_40210396-5_2-bombucha-hibiscus-lime-kombucha.jpg,,,,,,, ,Bombucha, , ,'40210396,'11518006000679, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,"Organic Crafted Kombucha (Fermented From RO Water, Organic Sugar, Organic Tea And Kombucha Culture) Hibiscus Flowers, Lime",Ready to Drink,"fermwell Foods Pvt Ltd ,106 Andheri universal estate, JP Road, Andheri West, Mumbai 58","Nutritional Values (per 100g)

Up until the age of 30, bone formation is faster than bone loss, which causes the skeleton to grow both in size and density, resulting in an overall increase in bone mass. After the age of 30, bone mineral density may start to decrease. Unfortunately, there are no visible signs of weak bones. They often go unnoticed over many years, with no symptoms or discomfort until a bone breaks. To maintain strong bones, you don't just need an adequate intake of Calcium, but also Vitamin D for Calcium absorption and Vitamin K2 for binding Calcium to bones, daily.
Remember, Vitamin K2 is not commonly found in the Indian diet, and Vitamin D is not even available in your daily diet.

Up until the age of 30, bone formation is faster than bone loss, which causes the skeleton to grow both in size and density, resulting in an overall increase in bone mass. After the age of 30, bone mineral density may start to decrease. Unfortunately, there are no visible signs of weak bones. They often go unnoticed over many years, with no symptoms or discomfort until a bone breaks. To maintain strong bones, you don't just need an adequate intake of Calcium, but also Vitamin D for Calcium absorption and Vitamin K2 for binding Calcium to bones, daily.
Remember, Vitamin K2 is not commonly found in the Indian diet, and Vitamin D is not even available in your daily diet. Horlicks Women's Plus is a bone nutrition specialist powered with Calseal formula. It provides 100% RDA^ of Calcium, Vitamin D and Vitamin K2 requirements.

Overindulged and need to fight post-meal sluggishness? Pour yourself a cup of Lipton After Lunch Green Tea. Green Tea is known for several benefits.

The catechins in the fresh leaves are preserved during the green tea process, making green tea rich in catechins. Also, green tea is typically drunk without milk and sugar and hence gives zero calories as compared to ordinary chai made with milk and sugar. Brewed, unsweetened Green Tea being 99% water is a great way to meet your daily required fluid intake. Green tea is also a great source of flavonoids.

Overindulged and need to fight post-meal sluggishness? Pour yourself a cup of Lipton After Lunch Green Tea. Green Tea is known for several benefits. Green tea is produced when freshly plucked leaves are heated, rolled/cut and then dried.
The catechins in the fresh leaves are preserved during the green tea process, making green tea rich in catechins. Also, green tea is typically drunk without milk and sugar and hence gives zero calories as compared to ordinary chai made with milk and sugar. Brewed, unsweetened Green Tea being 99% water is a great way to meet your daily required fluid intake. Green tea is also a great source of flavonoids.

Benefits:

Rose petals are a rich source of antioxidants such as polyphenols, particularly gallic acid. This antioxidant compound accounts for 10â55% of the teaâs total phenol content and is known to have anticancer, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and analgesic effects.
Rose petals extracts in this tea may alleviate menstrual pain.

It all begins with the leaf. The better the leaf, the better the powder. Shade-grown, nutrient-rich young Tencha green tea leaves are steamed, deveined, destemmed, dried and stone-ground into fine Matcha powder which is then consumed with water, ultimately leading to ingestion of whole tea leaves, making Matcha an extremely potent form of green tea or the âelixir of the immortalsâ as popularly known. A single serving of Matcha is considered equivalent to at least 10 cups of brewed green tea. A study in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition showed that drinking Matcha tea regularly results in significant reduction of body fat, enhanced mental function, improved immunity and anxiety relief.
