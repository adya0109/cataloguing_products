Once just a local legend through word of mouth, with its humble beginnings allegedly at the Buhari Hotel in Tamil Nadu in 1965, it is now a flavour known, loved and remixed all over India at eateries big and small - fancy and simple alike. Back in 1965, the Buhari Hotel in Tamil Nadu created a dish they called simply Chicken 65. And so the obsession began. Its distinct flavours have middle-of-the-road appeal to Indians nationwide despite their diverse tastes palates - that fact has always made this dish special.
Meanwhile in 2022, having spent their school years in Tamil Nadu, our co-founders Mikhel & Kshitij both had fond memories and nostalgia for the '65 flavour. We turned their taste of nostalgia into a Spice Mix you can use anytime, anywhere. So being us and nerd out over food the way we do, we decided to make it easy for you to simply sprinkle on some flavour with our 65 Spice Mix.

Sprig Wasabi paste has an unbelievable potency and adds a delightful bite to every dish. A tiny dab of this paste can even add an interesting dimension to vegetables like carrots and sweet potatoes. You can use it as a side with sushi, or roll it into sushi as one of the main ingredients.
Want to make great sushi? Or make your tempura sing in your mouth? The key ingredient that delivers a punch to both your sushi and your tempura is the wasabi paste. Sprig wasabi paste is now available in a convenient easy to use tube form. What is wasabi? Wasabi has its origins in Japanese cuisine. Wasabi root is actually the stem of the plant that is ground into a fine paste and consumed with sushi and other Japanese dishes. It is not spicy like a chilli paste, but it packs a wallop. It has a strong pungent taste that hits the roof of your nose rather than your tongue. It has a bite that is similar to the Bengali kasundi but much more stronger and with a clean herbal taste. Wasabi should be ingested in small quantities. It produces strong fumes that rise up and hits your nose and can potentially clear a nasal congestion! Wasabi is also available in powder form that you need to mix with water to get the desired consistency. Sprig wasabi paste comes premixed in a tube that is ready to use. How to use wasabi paste? Sprig wasabi paste can be used as a condiment with sushi and sashimi. You can mix it with mayonnaise and add it to sandwich or use it as a creamy dip. You can also use it as a dipping sauce for tempura/ fritters/ bajia/ pakoras. A huge variety of hors doeuvres can be spiced up with wasabi paste. You can add it to deviled eggs, salmon with wasabi soy and honey sauce and who can forget the wasabi peas that are very a popular snack. Wasabi can also be used alongside fish like tuna. Benefits? Seared tuna with wasabi butter sauce is the perfect dish for a Friday night indulgence. Wasabi, with its antibacterial properties, is very good for your health. Wasabi paste actually kills any bacteria that are present in the raw fish in sushi. Its vapour is so strong that it is used to treat respiratory problems like cough, cold or sinus. Wasabi can also stimulate the appetite and remove toxins from the body.
